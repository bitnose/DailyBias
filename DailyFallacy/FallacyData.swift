    Fallacy(title: "The Ad Hominem Argument ",
            shortDescription: "The fallacy of attempting to refute an argument by attacking the opposition’s intelligence.",
            longDescription: """
The Ad Hominem Argument is used to counter another argument. However, it's based on feelings of prejudice (often irrelevant to the argument), rather than facts, reason, and logic. An ad hominem argument is often a personal attack on someone's character or motive rather than an attempt to address the actual issue at hand.

This type of personal attack fallacy is often witnessed in debates in courtrooms and politics. Often, the attack is based on a person's social, political, or religious views. Either way, ad hominem fallacy attacks undermine the case and are to be avoided at all costs. You'll see why as we explore ad hominem examples below. Sometimes, people utilize ad hominem fallacy because they want to appeal to people's emotions. (Raise your hand if you've ever jumped to a conclusion based on emotion, rather than reason.) But, that's precisely why these kinds of arguments are often made of straw rather than of steel.

As soon as you spot someone coming after you with an ad hominem argument, you can counter their attack in two moves.Point out the irrelevance of the emotional testimony they've just introduced to the argument.

1) Point out their personal attack on you and highlight how it has nothing to do with the argument at hand. In fact, you can go so far as to ask them how - precisely - their personal attack is relevant to the argument at hand. Once you've exposed their weakness, move on.

2) Take the high road. You might say something to the effect of, I understand you think I'm X,Y, and Z, but that has nothing to do with what we are actually discussing here. So, I'm not going to entertain it any longer.
